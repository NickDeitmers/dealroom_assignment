# dealroom_assignment

I used this repository for the Data Science Internship case at Dealroom. The repository contains the following files:

- [The jupyter notebook file (with my code)](https://github.com/NickDeitmers/dealroom_assignment/blob/main/dealroom_internship_case.ipynb)
- [The original excel file (with the assignment)](https://github.com/NickDeitmers/dealroom_assignment/blob/main/Data_Science_Internship_Assignment.xlsx)  
- [The adjusted excel file (with my results)](https://github.com/NickDeitmers/dealroom_assignment/blob/main/Assignment_adjusted.xlsx)
- [A description file where I explain my code and thoughts](https://github.com/NickDeitmers/dealroom_assignment/blob/main/description.txt)
- [A .gitignore file](https://github.com/NickDeitmers/dealroom_assignment/blob/main/.gitignore.rtf)

I would be happy to answer any further questions.
