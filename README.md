# dealroom_assignment

I used this repository for the Data Science Internship case at Dealroom. The repository contains the following files:

- [The jupyter notebook file (with my used code)]()
- [The original excel file (with the assignment)]()  
- [The adjusted excel file (with my results)]()
- [A description file where I explain my code and thoughts]()

I would be happy to answer any further questions.
